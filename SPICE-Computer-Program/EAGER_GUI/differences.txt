> <\instruction>
> <instruction id=100008>On the next few screens imagine that you have just begun a new job on an accounting team at a generator manufacturing company. In this job you will be helping to determine how competing companies are doing in terms of actual sales relative to their reports of sales. To do this, you will need to solve several accounting problems. In these accounting problems you will have data from the competing company's warehouse inventory. You will have data on “actual inventory” derived from public shipping documents such as railroad and trucking manifests (when available) and “reported inventory” derived from the company’s semi-annual reports. Greater amounts of actual inventory compared to reported inventory will give an indication that the competing companies are inflating their profitability (i.e., they say they are selling more than they actually are). Your main goal is to accurately identify if this is occurring.  
> 
> While you are solving these accounting problems, you will also need to read emails and attend to other computer tasks (such as updating software). You should read the emails and alerts closely and before moving ahead because you will need to carefully decide how to respond to some emails and address the pop ups because these could affect your ability to complete your main task.
