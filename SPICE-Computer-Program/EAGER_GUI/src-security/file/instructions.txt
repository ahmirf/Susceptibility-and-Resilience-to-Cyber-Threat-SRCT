<instruction id   =   100000>PICTURE TASK

The goal of the following task is to hit one of two keys to indicate if a dot appears at the top or bottom of the computer screen. During the task, pictures will flash briefly on the computer screen followed by a dot.

When the task begins, rest your middle finger on the "i" key and your index finger on the "m" key. Tap the "i" key if the dot appears at the top of the screen and the "m" key if the dot appears at the bottom of the screen.

Before each set of pictures, you will see an "X" in the center of the screen. This lets you know that the next set of pictures and dot are about to appear.

Are you ready for some practice?
